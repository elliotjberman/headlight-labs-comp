## Setup
After cloning this repo, and making sure you've install python 3, run:

`cd wayne_face`

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

`python manage.py migrate`

`python manage.py createsuperuser`

This will be the user you have to demo with unfortunately, so make sure email and username are the same

`python manage.py runserver`

From there, the site will appear at `localhost:8000`
